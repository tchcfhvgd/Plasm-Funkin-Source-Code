--hi it's me cherry i made this cuz i was upset that i made an animation for a character that's equivalent to gf's "sad" animation
--and i realized it wasn't playing bc there's no code for the gf character to cry when a combo is broken 
--and i thought "wtf. i'm going to fix this no matter how frustrating the process is." so here's my efforts
--btw remove this text that proves *i* made this and i will come for your kneecaps -cherry
